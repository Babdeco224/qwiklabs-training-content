# Using Neural Networks to build ML model


## Overview

*Duration is 1 min*


This lab is part of a lab series, where you go from exploring a taxicab dataset to training and deploying a high-accuracy distributed model with Cloud ML Engine.

### __What you learn__

In this lab, you will use the `DNNRegressor` class in TensorFlow to predict median housing price

## Neural Networks

*Duration is 15 min*


__Step 1__

In Cloud Datalab, click on the __Home__ icon, and then navigate to __datalab \> notebooks \> training-data-analyst \> courses \> machine\_learning \> deepdive \> 05\_artandscience \> labs__ and open __c\_neuralnetwork.ipynb__.

<aside class="warning"><p>Note: If the cloud shell used for running the datalab command is closed or interrupted, the connection to your Cloud Datalab VM will terminate. If that happens, you may be able to reconnect using the command â€˜<strong>datalab connect mydatalabvm</strong>&#39; in your new Cloud Shell. Once connected, try the above step again.</p>
</aside>

__Step 2__

In Datalab, click on __Clear | Clear all Cells__. Now read the narrative and execute each cell in turn.
