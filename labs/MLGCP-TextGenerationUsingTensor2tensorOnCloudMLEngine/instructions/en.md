# Text generation using tensor2tensor on Cloud ML Engine


## Overview

*Duration is 1 min*


This notebook illustrates using the tensor2tensor library to do from-scratch, distributed training of a poetry model. Then, the trained model is used to complete new poems.

### What you learn

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Create a training dataset from text data
* Utilize the tensor2tensor library for text classification
* Train the model locally
* Train on Cloud Machine Learning Engine

## Text generation using tensor2tensor on Cloud ML Engine

*Duration is 15 min*


__Step 1__

In Cloud Datalab, click on the __Home__ icon, and then navigate to __datalab \> notebooks \> training-data-analyst \> courses \> machine\_learning \> deepdive \> 09\_sequence__ and open __poetry.ipynb__.

<aside class="warning"><p>Note: If the cloud shell used for running the datalab command is closed or interrupted, the connection to your Cloud Datalab VM will terminate. If that happens, you may be able to reconnect using the command â€˜<strong>datalab connect mydatalabvm</strong>&#39; in your new Cloud Shell. Once connected, try the above step again.</p>
</aside>

__Step 2__

Read through the assignment steps required in the first notebook cell and complete them in your notebook.
