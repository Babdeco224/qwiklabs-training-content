title: 'Big Data & ML Fundamentals Lab 2: Interact with Google Cloud Storage v1.3'
description: In this lab you spin up a virtual machine, configure its API access,
  and log into it remotely.  You will rarely work with Compute Engine instances at
  such a low-level, but knowing the foundations of GCP can be helpful in troubleshooting. You then carry out the steps of an ingest-transform-and-publish
  data pipeline manually.
