# An RNN Model for Temperature Data


## Overview

*Duration is 1 min*


In this lab, you will define a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model to do time-series prediction on real world temperature data.

### What you learn

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Run the RNN model with basic settings as a baseline
* Adjust hyperparameters for performance tuning
* Adjust the window of predictions for less noisy data


## Setup

## Time Series Weather Data Prediction

*Duration is 15 min*


__Step 1__

In Cloud Datalab, click on the __Home__ icon, and then navigate to __datalab \> notebooks \> training-data-analyst \> courses \> machine\_learning \> deepdive > 09\_sequence \> labs__ and open __temperatures.ipynb__.

<aside class="warning"><p>Note: If the cloud shell used for running the datalab command is closed or interrupted, the connection to your Cloud Datalab VM will terminate. If that happens, you may be able to reconnect using the command â€˜<strong>datalab connect mydatalabvm</strong>&#39; in your new Cloud Shell. Once connected, try the above step again.</p>
</aside>


__Step 2__

In Datalab, click on __Clear | Clear all Cells__ (click on Clear, then in the drop-down menu, select Clear all Cells).

Read through the assignment steps required in the first notebook cell (starting with *Run the notebook as it is. Look at the data visualisations)* and complete them in your notebook.

If you need more help, you may take a look at the complete solution by navigating to : __datalab \> notebooks \> training-data-analyst \> courses \> machine\_learning \> deepdive \> 09\_sequence__  and open __temperatures.ipynb__
